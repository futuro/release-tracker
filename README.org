* Justenough Software Release Tracker
  This repo allows tracking the release status of various public
  projects on Github, to make keeping up with new releases easier.
** Project Goal
   The original impetus for this project was as a take home exercise
   for a job interview, focused around tracking OSS releases.

   Building on this original impetus, I wanted to try out a bundle of
   new tech I've been curious about for a while now, namely:
   - Fulcro
   - Pathom
   - GraphQL
   - And then a graphdb with datalog support, starting with Asami and
     then switching to Datascript
** Short project history
   Since this was a time-boxed exercise, one might suggest not using
   almost all totally new technology, but I couldn't resist the chance
   to give some new things a try and see how much I could get done
   with them.

   I fleshed out the very beginnings of a UI with Fulcro; spent a fair
   amount of time learning both Pathom and GraphQL -- in the hopes that I
   could get automatic query resolution between my Fulcro components
   and the GitHub GraphQL API -- before setting them aside; and
   ultimately built out a fairly barebones http server with Ring and
   Compojure to simply get something out the door.

   I tried out Asami as a backing store but ran into issues with NPEs
   when a logic variable didn't resolve to existing entities and chose
   to use Datascript instead because I was more familiar with it and I
   suspected it would have the least setup and fewest gotchas among
   the options I had available.
** Caveats
   Since this project is time boxed, and primarily meant to showcase
   some of my skills and be the catalyst for a conversation about my
   methodologies, there are rough edges.

   I've outlined some of what I would do in the future under the
   [[* Future Work]] section, but you should know that:
   - You're probably going to get some errors, depending on how far
     off the "happy" path you wander
   - Some things are missing from the repo not because I wouldn't
     normally include them in a production server, but because they
     didn't fit within the time and user story constraints of the
     project.
** How to run the server
   To run the server, first ensure you've got clojure installed on
   your machine.

   Then set up a personal github OAuth token in
   ~resources/config/secrets.edn~. This file is not tracked by github,
   and should have the following structure:
   #+begin_src clojure
     {:github/auth {:user/token "YOUR TOKEN HERE"}}
   #+end_src

   Finally, run ~clojure -M:server~.

   Once it's started, you can interact with it via your favorite HTTP
   client.

   Alternatively, use your favorite editor to start up a repl (nREPL
   perhaps), and make use of the ~:dev~ alias to bring in the extra
   deps you'll need.

   There is also an experimental UI portion to this project, which you can
   read more about at [[* Experimental namespaces]]. The given command
   above does not meaningfully tie into the UI 
** Endpoints
   You can find the route definitions in the
   ~justenough.software.release-tracker.server.middleware~ namespace,
   but here's a short overview:
   | VERB | Route                           | Returns                                       |
   |------+---------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------|
   | GET  | /repo                           | All of the repos currently tracked            |
   | GET  | /repo/<user>/<repo name>        | Info on a specific repo                       |
   | POST | /repo/<user>/<repo name>/track  | Tracks the given repo                         |
   | POST | /repo/<user>/<repo name>/update | Fetches/updates the releases for the  repo    |
   | POST | /repo/<user>/<repo name>/seen   | Marks the latest release as seen for the repo |
** Namespaces of primary consideration
   For the server itself, you'll want to start with
   ~justenough.software.release-tracker.server~, and then
   ~justenough.software.release-tracker.util~, as well as everything
   under ~justenough.software.release-tracker.server.*~

   There's also ~justenough.software.dev.user~, which is useful while
   developing the server.

   Check out ~resources/config/~ for the configuration file. This is
   also where you'll put your ~secrets.edn~ config.

   Ignore every CLJS file.
** Experimental namespaces
   The experimental namespaces are all contained in the CLJS files. In
   here you'll find the work I did at the beginning to build out a UI
   before building a backend.

   This is functional, though it doesn't contain all of the MVP
   functionality, and filling in that functionality, as well as
   connecting it to the backend, is solidly in the =Future Work=
   category.

   That being said, Fulcro has a lot of really powerful ideas, so if
   you'd like to see what I built while effectively starting with zero
   Fulcro knowledge, the following sections
*** Running the Fulcro code
    1. Create a ns ~justenough.software.release-tracker.secrets~ at
       ~src/main/justenough/software/release_tracker/secrets.cljs~
       with one var, ~user-token~, that contains your GitHub OAuth token
       as a string. This file is not tracked by git.
    2. Install yarn or npm
    3. Run ~yarn install~ or ~npm install~
    4. Run ~npx shadow-cljs server~
    5. Open ~http://localhost:9630/build/main~
    6. Compile the project
    7. Open ~http://localhost:8000/~
    8. Search for repos and hit the Track button

    That's about it from the UI perspective; most of the magic is
    happening in the source code and with how Fulcro manages state and
    connects components.
*** Source code
    ~justenough.software.release-tracker.client~ is a good starting
    namespace. It defines how the app starts up, and ties the UI and
    the app state together.

    Next, check out ~justenough.software.release-tracker.ui~, which
    defines the root component, and thus all sub-components. Following
    this trail you can see how the Search component is built, as well
    as how the list of tracked repos is built.

    Leveraging the [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fulcro-inspect/meeijplnfjcihnhkpanepcaffklobaal][Fulcro Inspect]] addon for Chrome/Chromium is really
    helpful in understanding what's going on under the hood, and I
    recommend installing it if you want to dig deeper into how Fulcro
    is working.
** Future Work
   Here's a list of things I'd do next were this an actual production
   project.
   - Write tests
   - Choose a durable backend store that supported Datalog queries,
     maybe XTDB
   - Flesh out the edge cases around marking repos without releases as
     =seen=
   - Build out Pathom support
   - Connect the Frontend and Backend code together, moving the GitHub
     queries and mutations to the backend
   - Figure out how/if I could get automatic/easy Component Query ->
     GitHub GraphQL translation support, thus enabling even more
     seamless query support.
   - Make the error handling more robust
   - Separate the data CRUD and display layers in the backend; f.e.
     the format of output that I'd want for a CLI interface is very
     different from what I'd want sent back to Fulcro in the browser,
     and having these concerns colocated causes fragility.

   I'm sure there's more, but these are the ones top of mind at this
   point.
** Misc
*** MVP User Stories
**** DONE Users can add GitHub repos they want to track
     The app keeps track of the added repos -- using
     LocalStorage/IndexedDB or similar, no need for a backend -- until
     the application data is cleared.
***** DONE repo searching
****** DONE The actual searching
       This is complete
****** DONE Displaying the results
       I've got a barebones display that just shows the name of the
       repo.

       This looks pretty ugly atm, so pulling in semantic UI might be
       nice, and also save me any UI tweaking
***** DONE a list of repos we're following
***** DONE a way to add from the search results
**** DONE Users can see the latest release date for each repo
**** DONE Users can mark a release as seen
**** TODO There's a visual indicator for repositories with new releases
     New since they were last marked seen
**** DONE There is a way to reload release data for all repos
     This one needs some clarification what "reload" means. I /suspect/
     it's "pull the release data from ghub", but I want to make sure it
     isn't "clear the _seen_ state".
**** TODO update README with instructions on running the project
     This wasn't part of the MVP section in the email, but I find it
     meaningful anyways. Also, it'll fill in for the requirements
     around having docs on running the project.
**** No need for formal user or authentication concept at this point

*** Optional goals past MVP
**** Release notes/other data we might want to present in a details view
**** Mobile responsive?
**** When to load/update data, what loading states should there be
**** Filter or sort the repo list
     To easily see which repos have new releases since last we marked
     them seen.
**** Additional personal metadata
     F.e. the ability to mark a release as something to revisit, or as
     something to update in other projects
**** Support more data points to mark new releases
     Some projects don't use GitHub releases, so support some other
     data points for marking new releases; perhaps commit activity.
**** Desktop/mobile notifications
     This seems somewhat vague, so it probably needs a collab session
     with Tom to sort out what this means.

     Alternatively, it's not vague to someone that's done more frontend
     work, but it'll still require a collab session with Tom.
**** Add a backend to this service
     This is worded as such:
     #+begin_quote
     How would you build a real server for this / turn this into a
     service that would store data beyond the local browser?
     #+end_quote

     From this, I could see either an RFC-style kind of proposal that
     talks about the "how" without actually building it, but it might
     also build it out.
***** OAuth
      Personally, I think it'd be neat to sort out OAuth with this, so
      that we could get access to larger API request limits, as well as
      private repos, but perhaps that's another goal altogether.
